## A simple command-line application using [Realm Dart SDK](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/flutter/#dart-standalone-realm) Flexible Sync with [Atlas App Services application](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/).
This sample demonstrates the usage of Flexible Sync with Realm Dart SDK. 
Writing to a local realm sends the data automatically to the Atlas Cloud Collection.
Then the local realm is subscribed only for items matching specific query criterias.
This causes the local realm to be populated only with specific items matching the filter. 
All other items will exist only in Atlas cloud collection.

# Realm Dart SDK

The Realm Dart package is `realm_dart` and it is available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/realm_dart)

## Environment setup for Realm Dart

* Supported platforms are Windows, Mac and Linux.

* Dart SDK

# Atlas App Services Configuration Steps

* Create an account on [realm.mongodb.com](https://realm.mongodb.com) - follow the instructions: [Get Started with Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started)
* Create a new app following the instructions here: [Create an App with Atlas App Services UI](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/manage-apps/create/create-with-realm-ui).
    For the purpose of this sample you don't need to create an app from a template. You can just create an empty application.
* Go to the `Authentication Providers` menu in the left panel and make sure the option "Allow users to log in anonymously" is ON. Save and then click the button in the blue line above - `Review draft & deploy`. Read [this page](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/providers/) for more information about the other types of authentication.
* Go to the `Sync` menu and [Enable Flexible Sync](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/configure/enable-sync/#enable-flexible-sync).
    * Don't create a schema. Skip by choosing "No thanks, continue to Sync".
    * Press the "Flexible Sync" button. Only Flexible Sync is supported in the Realm Dart SDK.
    * Switch ON the ["Development mode"](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/data-model/development-mode/) option. 
    * Create a new database collection and choose a name for it.
    * Create a new queryable field used for filtering data between both realms in this application. For our sample the fields are `status` and `progressMinutes`. 
        Since it is not available in the selection list, just start writing inside the selection box and then choose `Create status`. 
        It will be created.
        Do the same for the field `progressMinutes`.
    * Define permission - for the purpose of this sample please choose the option `Users can read and write all data`.
    * Click the button `Enable Sync` and confirm.
    * Click the button in the blue line above - `Review draft & deploy`, again.
* Copy the App ID of your new application. Follow [Find an App ID](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/reference/find-your-project-or-app-id/#find-an-app-id)
* Go to `tasktracker.dart` in this sample and set your App ID to the constant `appId` as follow: 
    ```dart
    String appId = "tasktracker-fleld";;
    ```

These steps are for the purpose of the sample. You can follow the instructions 
in [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas) for more advanced and secured configurations.

## Usage

* Install the `realm_dart` package into the application. This downloads and copies the required native binaries to the app directory.

    ```
    dart run realm_dart install
    ``` 

*  Run the application

    ```
    dart run
    ```

* Check the data and schema in you Atlas collection.
    * Login in [realm.mongodb.com](https://realm.mongodb.com) with your account.
    * Go to your application and open `Schema` menu. You can see the newly created JSON schema 
        that represents your data model defined in `model.dart` file in this sample. 
        For more details [see](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/schemas/?_ga=2.267468942.1225817147.1654079983-1571915642.1647002315&_gac=1.216786660.1654173423.CjwKCAjwv-GUBhAzEiwASUMm4jBtzETN-YJq0KELgeGLKk-4_6wVAfImtPoBbo-A35_eKjZ1p0Lh_BoCotcQAvD_BwE)
    * Go to Atlass and [browse the collection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/collections/#view-collections). All the tasks objects should be listed there.
